#MesaKit

MesaKit is a fictional table reservation app for a restaurant, designed to enhance user experience by making table booking simple, responsive, and visually appealing.

  It features:

-Selectable tables with capacity display

-Selection of the number of people

-A custom green-orange theme with colors I personally enjoy

-A confirmation message upon booking

This front-end UI was built using React, Material UI, CSS Grid, custom styling, and Git/GitHub for version control.


Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mesakit.git
cd mesakit
npm install
npm run dev
